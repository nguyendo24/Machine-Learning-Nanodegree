* Python version used: 3.6
* Tensorflow version used: 1.0.0
* Other libraries used: pickle, cv2
* Full implementation: [here]()
* helper function implementation: [here]()
* If you are runnning the code from scratch, augmentation step might take a long time due to length of the dataset. So have patience. 
* Training on a decent CPU might take around 15 minutes and on a decent GPU, it might take around 2 minutes.
